# xchange-xtension
A Google Chrome extension that converts currency amounts on hover using live exchange rates.

As many souls who have lived abroad know, moving between different countries means that you are constantly doing mental or physical math while online shopping. While this might be beneficial, it certainly is sometimes a real inconvenience. Having the ability to accurately convert currencies on the fly would save us not only time but also brain cells to dedicate to other productive endeavors. Though there exists applications that can do conversion by typing in or highlighting input, xchange-xtension makes the user experience frictionless by detecting and doing currency exchanges upon only a mouse hover.
